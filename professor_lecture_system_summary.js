/*
CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:

1. LECTURE HISTORY RESTRUCTURE:
   âœ… Removed general lecture history
   âœ… Implemented per-professor lecture history
   âœ… Added professor filter dropdown
   âœ… Added week-based filtering

2. NEW UI COMPONENTS:

   âœ… Week dropdown now filters existing lectures
   âœ… Professor tags in history items
   âœ… Enhanced actions (View, Download, Delete)

3. NEW STORAGE STRUCTURE:
   Before: lectureHistory = [lecture1, lecture2, ...]
   After: professorLectureHistory = {
     'dr-smith': [lecture1, lecture2, ...],
     'prof-chen': [lecture1, lecture2, ...],
     'dr-wilson': [lecture1, lecture2, ...],
     'prof-taylor': [lecture1, lecture2, ...]
   }

4. NEW FILTERING LOGIC:
   âœ… Filter by professor (show only selected professor's lectures)
   âœ… Filter by week (show only lectures for selected week)
   âœ… Combined filtering (show professor X's lectures for week Y)
   âœ… Sort by timestamp (most recent first)

5. ENHANCED FEATURES:
   âœ… Up to 20 lectures stored per professor (was 10 total)
   âœ… Professor-specific download functionality
   âœ… Better visual organization with professor tags
   âœ… Week and professor combination filtering

6. USER WORKFLOW:
