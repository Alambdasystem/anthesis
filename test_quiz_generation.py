        Welcome to Week 3 of Python Programming Fundamentals. 
        Today we'll explore object-oriented programming concepts including classes, objects, and inheritance.
        
        A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Think of it as a template that defines the properties 
        and methods that objects of that class will have. For example, if we have a Car class, it might 
        have properties like color, make, model, and year, and methods like start(), stop(), and accelerate().
        
        Objects are instances of classes. When you create an object from a class, you're instantiating 
        that class. Each object has its own set of property values but shares the same methods defined 
        in the class.
        
        Inheritance allows us to create new classes based on existing classes. The new class (child class) 
        inherits properties and methods from the parent class, and can also have its own additional 
        properties and methods. This promotes code reuse and creates hierarchical relationships between classes.
        
        Let's look at a practical example:
        
        class Animal:
            def __init__(self, name, species):
                self.name = name
                self.species = species
            
            def make_sound(self):
                return "Some generic animal sound"
        
        class Dog(Animal):
            def __init__(self, name, breed):
                super().__init__(name, "Canine")
                self.breed = breed
            
            def make_sound(self):
                return "Woof!"
        
        Key concepts to remember:
        1. Encapsulation - bundling data and methods together
        2. Inheritance - creating new classes from existing ones
        3. Polymorphism - same method name, different implementations
        4. Abstraction - hiding complex implementation details
