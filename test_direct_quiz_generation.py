    Introduction to Network Security
    
    Today we'll explore the fundamentals of network security, including:
    
    1. Network Security Concepts
    - Firewalls and their types (packet filtering, stateful, application-level)
    - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
    - Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for secure remote access
    
    2. Common Network Threats
    - Man-in-the-middle attacks
    - DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks
    - Port scanning and vulnerability assessments
    - SQL injection through web applications
    
    3. Network Security Protocols
    - SSL/TLS for encrypted communications
    - IPSec for network layer security
    - WPA2/WPA3 for wireless network security
    
    4. Best Practices
    - Network segmentation to limit attack scope
    - Regular security audits and penetration testing
    - Keeping systems and software updated
    - Employee training on security awareness
    
    5. Practical Implementation
    Students will configure a basic firewall and analyze network traffic
    to identify potential security threats.
