We will also discuss the importance of semantic markup, accessibility, and responsive design.\n\n### What is Web Development?\n\nWeb development refers to the process of building websites, web applications, and mobile applications that can be accessed over the internet. It involves writing code in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using various tools and frameworks.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n#### 1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)\n\nHTML is used for structuring content on the web. It consists of a series of elements, called tags, which are used to define the structure and presentation of a document.\n\n* **Tags**: The basic building blocks of HTML, which define the start and end of an element.\n* **Elements**: The actual content within a tag, such as headings, paragraphs, images, etc.\n* **Attributes**: Additional information that can be applied to an element, such as style or font size.\n\n#### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)\n\nCSS is used for styling and layout on the web. It allows developers to separate presentation from structure, making it easier to maintain and update websites.\n\n* **Selectors**: Used to target specific HTML elements in a document.\n* **Properties**: Used to define the style of an element, such as color, font size, etc.\n* **Values**: The actual values assigned to a property.\n\n#### 3. JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is used for adding interactivity and dynamic effects to web pages. It allows developers to respond to user interactions, update content dynamically, and create more complex behaviors.\n\n* **Variables**: Used to store and manipulate data in a script.\n* **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code that can be called multiple times.\n* **Events**: Triggers that set off actions or responses in JavaScript.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### 1. Basic HTML Structure\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n <title>Example Website</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n <h1>Welcome to our website!</h1>\n <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code defines the basic structure of an HTML document, including the doctype declaration, head section, and body section.\n\n#### 2. CSS Styling\n\n```css\nbody {\n background-color: #f2f2f2;\n font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n}\n\nh1 {\n color: #00698f;\n font-size: 36px;\n text-align: center;\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines two styles using selectors and properties: one for the body element, and another for the h1 element.\n\n#### 3. JavaScript Interactivity\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"Hello World!\");\n\nlet name = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\ndocument.write(`Hello ${name}!`);\n```\n\nThis code uses JavaScript to log a message to the console, prompt the user for their name, and then write a greeting message to the document.\n\n### Practical Applications\n\n#### 1. Build a Simple Web Page\n\nUse the HTML and CSS concepts learned in this week's lecture to build a simple web page with a heading, paragraph, and button.\n\n#### 2.

Web developers use a variety of tools and technologies to build and deploy websites, including web frameworks, databases, and content management systems.\n\n### Why Learn Web Development?\n-----------------------------\n\nWeb development is a highly sought-after skill in the job market. With more and more companies moving online, the demand for skilled web developers has never been higher. By learning web development, you can:\n\n* Create your own website or blog\n* Build a career in web development\n* Enhance your skills in other areas of software development\n* Stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving tech industry\n\n### Setting Up Your Environment\n-----------------------------\n\nTo get started with web development, you will need to set up your environment. This includes:\n\n* Installing a code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom\n* Setting up a text editor such as Notepad++ or Brackets\n* Creating a new project folder and installing the necessary dependencies\n\n**Example:** Create a new project folder called `web-dev` and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt. Install Node.js and npm (the package manager for Node.js) by running the following commands:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g node\nnpm install -g npm\n```\n\n### Key Concepts in Web Development\n----------------------------------\n\n#### HTML\n\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the structure and content of a website. It consists of tags that define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables, etc.\n\n**Example:**\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Web Development</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Welcome to Web Development!</h1>\n    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>\n    <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"An image on the page\">\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### CSS\n\nCSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the layout and visual styling of a website. It consists of rules that define how elements should be displayed, such as font sizes, colors, and margins.\n\n**Example:**\n```css\nbody {\n    background-color: #f2f2f2;\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n}\n\nh1 {\n    color: #00698f;\n    margin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n#### JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic effects to a website. It can be used for tasks such as animating elements, handling user input, and making API calls.\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"Hello World!\");\nlet name = prompt(\"What's your name? \");\ndocument.write(\"Welcome \" + name);\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n----------\n\nIn this lecture, we covered the basics of web development, including what it is, why learn it, setting up your environment, and key concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also provided examples to illustrate each concept.\n\nNext time, we will dive deeper into HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and explore how to build a simple web application from scratch.\n\n**Assignment:**\n\n* Set up your development environment\n* Create a new project folder and write an HTML file with the following content:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Web Development</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Welcome to Web Development!</h1>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n* Open the HTML file in a web browser and verify that it displays correctly.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* Codecademy's Web Development Course\n* Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Documentation\n* FreeCodeCamp's Web Development Tutorials",
