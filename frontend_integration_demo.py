# Week 3: Network Security Fundamentals

## Introduction
Network security is a critical component of cybersecurity that focuses on protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and accessibility of computer networks and data.

## Key Network Security Concepts

### 1. Firewalls
Firewalls act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

Types of Firewalls:
- Packet-filtering firewalls
- Stateful inspection firewalls
- Proxy firewalls
- Next-generation firewalls (NGFW)

### 2. Network Segmentation
Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the spread of attacks and improve security.

Benefits:
- Reduces attack surface
- Limits lateral movement of attackers
- Improves network performance
- Enables better monitoring

### 3. VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)
VPNs create secure, encrypted connections over public networks, allowing remote users to securely access corporate resources.

VPN Types:
- Site-to-site VPNs
- Remote access VPNs
- SSL/TLS VPNs
- IPSec VPNs

### 4. Intrusion Detection and Prevention
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems)**: Actively block detected threats
- **NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems)**: Monitor entire network segments

### 5. Network Access Control (NAC)
NAC solutions enforce security policies on devices attempting to access network resources.

## Common Network Threats

1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Attackers intercept communications between two parties
2. **DDoS Attacks**: Overwhelming network resources with traffic
3. **Port Scanning**: Discovering open ports and services
4. **Network Sniffing**: Intercepting and analyzing network packets
5. **Rogue Access Points**: Unauthorized wireless access points

## Best Practices

1. **Defense in Depth**: Use multiple layers of security controls
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor network traffic and logs
3. **Access Control**: Implement principle of least privilege
4. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep network devices and software updated
6. **Security Policies**: Establish and enforce clear security policies

## Network Security Tools

- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer
- **Nmap**: Network discovery and security auditing
- **Metasploit**: Penetration testing framework
- **Snort**: Open-source intrusion detection system
- **pfSense**: Open-source firewall and router

Understanding these fundamentals is essential for building and maintaining secure network infrastructures.
