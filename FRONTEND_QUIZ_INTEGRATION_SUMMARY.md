## Frontend Quiz Integration Summary

### âœ… Integration Complete

The cadet dashboard frontend has been successfully integrated with the quiz generation backend. Here's what was implemented:

### ðŸ”§ Frontend Changes Made

1. **Updated `generateMatchingQuiz()` function**:
   - Now calls the `/api/quizzes/generate-from-lecture` endpoint
   - Retrieves lecture content from local storage or API
   - Shows loading spinner during generation
   - Handles errors gracefully

2. **Added `displayGeneratedQuiz()` function**:
   - Displays quiz in an interactive format
   - Shows multiple choice questions with radio buttons
   - Provides immediate feedback when answers are selected
   - Includes quiz submission and scoring

3. **Added supporting functions**:
   - `updateQuestionFeedback()` - Shows correct/incorrect feedback
   - `submitQuiz()` - Calculates score and shows results
   - `retakeQuiz()` - Allows retaking quizzes

4. **Updated lecture displays**:
